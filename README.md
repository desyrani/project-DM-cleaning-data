**Overview**

This project is focused on data cleaning techniques, which is a critical step in the data mining process. Proper cleaning of data helps in improving the quality of data, removing inconsistencies, and ensuring that models trained on the cleaned data will have better performance. The project specifically applies Linear Regression and Logistic Regression on cleaned data for predictive modeling.

The key goal of this project is to demonstrate how proper data cleaning can improve the performance of machine learning models like Linear Regression and Logistic Regression, and how they can be applied to real-world datasets after cleaning.

**Key Components:**

- **Data Cleaning:** Handling missing values, removing duplicates, fixing inconsistencies, and transforming data into a usable format.
- **Linear Regression:** Used for predicting continuous variables.
- **Logistic Regression:** Applied for binary classification tasks.
